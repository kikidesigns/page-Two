# 3D Tarot Web Application - Project Status

## Project Overview
Modern 3D Tarot application built with Three.js and TypeScript, featuring interactive card readings and multiplayer support.

## Current Status
🚀 Development Phase - Testing and Debugging

### Active Issues
1. Card texture visibility:
   - Cards showing black on one side
   - Black with red squares on other side
   - Need to verify texture mapping
   - Need to debug texture loading pipeline

### Recently Completed
- Profile UI components ✅
  - Creation form ✅
  - Image upload interface ✅
  - Profile selector ✅
  - Card grid manager ✅
- Error handling system ✅
- Upload feedback system ✅
- Profile persistence ✅

### In Progress
- Debugging texture visibility
- Testing profile UI components
- Card spread positioning
- Performance optimization

### Next Steps
1. Fix texture mapping issues
2. Add texture debugging tools
3. Complete profile UI testing
4. Implement card spread positioning

## Testing Instructions

### Profile Management
1. Create new profile:
   - Click "New Profile"
   - Fill in details
   - Save profile
   - Verify it appears in selector

2. Upload images:
   - Use drag & drop or file select
   - Verify upload feedback
   - Click "Save & Apply"
   - Check persistence

3. Edit profiles:
   - Switch between profiles
   - Edit existing profiles
   - Remove images
   - Verify changes save

### Known Issues
1. Texture Visibility:
   - Default textures not showing properly
   - Uploaded textures not visible
   - Need to verify mapping coordinates
   - Need to check texture loading

2. Performance:
   - Multiple texture loading needs optimization
   - Memory management for large decks
   - Card spread positioning incomplete
