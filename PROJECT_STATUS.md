   - Added camera transitions
   - Integrated with state management

2. Core system improvements:
   - Enhanced deck visualization
   - Added card animation system
   - Improved UI feedback
   - Added debug logging

## Next Steps
1. Complete card spread positioning
2. Develop image upload system (Issue #2)
3. Create image processing utilities (Issue #5)
4. Integrate texture management

## Performance Metrics
- Render Performance: 60 FPS target âœ…
- Load Time: < 2s initial load âœ…
- Memory Usage: < 100MB baseline âœ…
- State Updates: < 16ms âœ…

## Known Issues
- Card visibility needs improvement
- Test cube needs removal
- Spread positions need implementation
